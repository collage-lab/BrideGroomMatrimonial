            <br />
        </strong>The first step in protecting your online privacy is creating a safe password
            - i.e. one that a computer program or persistent individual won't easily be able
            to guess in a short period of time. To help you choose a secure password, we've
            created a feature that lets you know visually how safe your password is as soon
            as you create it.<br />
